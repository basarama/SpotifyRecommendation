# SpotifyRecommendation

## Purpose:
The vision of this app is to generate recommendations from Spotify for a user. Given a user's listening habits this app maps a listener's top genres and provides notifications on a recurring basis when new music is released that matches their listening habits.
Spotify describes music with several features: acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, valence, and tempo.
Given a users top songs we would see if any of these traits are significantly grouped and generate recommendations in the future based off those.

## Functionality:
- [ ] Login user
- [ ] Fetch top songs / artists
- [ ] Analyze favourite songs and most listened to songs of top artists to find commoon musical characteristics
- Loop
  - [ ] Check new songs on spotify
  - [ ] Search through users for strong matches
  - [ ] Recommend songs to users

## Next Steps:
- Serverless Architecture
> The design lends itself well to a serverless design as the main program is a recurring search on spotify for new music recommendations.
- React client integration
> React seems a strong choice for designing the frontend
- Machine Learning for recommendations
> Another obvious next step would be to implement a similar algorithm with machine learning
